- Hi, I’m Josh, a software engineer in the Atlanta metro area!
- In my free time, I run tabletop roleplaying games (TTRPGs) for several groups of people! I also enjoy hiking with my family and mountain biking the singletrack trails along the Chattahoochee River.
- I’m currently working for Intuit Mailchimp on the Partnerships team.
- I'm always looking to network with other industry professionals in the Atlanta metro area.
