- Hi, I’m Josh, a software engineer in the Atlanta metro area!
- Tabletop roleplaying games (TTRPGs), hiking with my family, and mountain biking are my favorite activities outside of work.
- I’m currently working for Intuit Mailchimp on the Partnerships team.
- I'm always looking to network with other industry professionals in the Atlanta metro area.
